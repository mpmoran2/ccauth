# How do we validate a CC
    -Say we have a cc number
        5610 5910 8101 8250
        -We assign an index number for each
        -Extract the sum of all Odd numbers in the CC number
        -Find the double of all even numbers
            -if the double is a double digit number, add them together
                -ex 10 = 1+0 = 1
            -Find sum of all the index'sum
        -Add the odd sum and even sum
        -Divide by 10
            -if the remainder is 0 = Valid if !0 = not valid
